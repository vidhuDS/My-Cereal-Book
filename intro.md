# Which cereal is your favourite and why?

Having a good healthy breakfast is a great start to the day. With busy life schedule, milk and cereals are a easy breakfast options. This book is an exploration to learn more about cereals, their history, nutrition facts and factors leading to popularity of certain cereals over others. Some factors that come to mind as possible reasons for a given cereal brand to be popular are taste, nutrition content, value for money, and ease of availability. With many marketing campaigns, high protein content, fiber content and low sugar, calories are also expected to be responsible to make some cereal brands to be more popular. As customers are becoming more and more health conscious, cereals with high sugar/calories may have lost interest.
This won't go in depth, but just a little exploration to look at the history and also where we have reached now.
